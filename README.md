# ShivaDrop

### **Fast, Secure, Peer-to-Peer File Sharing** ðŸš€

ShivaDrop is a web-based, decentralized application for securely sharing files directly between two devices. Built on **WebRTC** (Web Real-Time Communication), it eliminates the need for a central server, ensuring your data remains private and is never stored in the cloud.

-----

## Features

  - **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Transfers:** Files are sent directly from one browser to another, providing maximum speed and bypassing the need for a middleman.
  - **No File Size Limits:** Transfer large files effortlessly since the data doesn't pass through a server with bandwidth constraints.
  - **Secure & Private:** Your data is encrypted and transferred directly between peers, ensuring end-to-end privacy.
  - **Cross-Platform:** Works seamlessly on any modern web browser across different operating systems.
  - **Intuitive Interface:** A simple, clean design makes it easy for anyone to create a room and share files.

## How It Works

ShivaDrop uses WebRTC to establish a direct, peer-to-peer connection. A small, lightweight signaling server helps the two browsers find each other, but once the connection is made, the server steps aside. The file transfer then happens directly between your devices, making it incredibly fast and private.
